        h5 We've launched!
        p Welcome to lift.zone!  We've just launched, and invite codes are slowly rolling out to those that asked for them.
        p Currently the #[b validate] email isn't sending. We're waiting for our email service to be promoted out of sandbox mode.  Once that's done you can validate your account. Sorry this didn't get done before launch.
        p Right now all that you can do is log workouts and look up past workouts.  Coming soon: Sharing workouts with others, and editing your activity names (this will allow you to free-form type in aliases for activities rather than relying on the 'suggestions' dialog in the new workout page.
        p Please let me know if anything is still not working, or confusing. I'll do my best to clarify and bugfix, as I have time.
        p Happy lifting!
