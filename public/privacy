Other examples of non-personally-identifiable information include:</p><ol><li>Your IP address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web; many Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address).</li><li>Your "top level" domain (i.e., .com, .net, .edu, etc.).</li><li>Standard information included with every communication sent on the Internet, such as browser type, operating system, browser language, service provider, and local time.</li></ol><p>We collect data from the Web logs of the servers -- the computers that "serve up" Web pages -- delivering content on lift.zone. This includes information about what you view and, along with information gathered from our other users, we create "aggregate data" reports that we may disclose to third parties. We may also study aggregate data in order to enhance our existing services or develop new services.</p><p>We will not disclose any personal information to a third party without your express prior written authorization, as described under 'Collection of personal information' below.

When you click on such a link, you will leave lift.zone. The privacy policy of the external website will then be in effect, not our policy.

We may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p></article><h3>Effect of Privacy Policy</h3><article><p>This privacy policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party. As noted above, we may revise this privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion.</p></article><h3>Security issues</h3><article><p>If you are a lift.zone user and have a concern regarding the security of your account, please contact us via email at security@lift.zone.</p></article><article><p>If you have found a security vulnerability in lift.zone or have a security incident to report, please email security@lift.zone.
